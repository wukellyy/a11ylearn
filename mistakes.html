          History of desserts
        </h2>
        <p class="italic mb-4 text-slate-400">
          Dessert foods have a rich history, spanning from ancient civilizations
          to modern times. From the ancient Egyptians' honey and fruit
          concoctions, to the intricate pastries of France and gelato
          innovations in Italy, desserts have evolved over time, reflecting
          cultural preferences and culinary techniques from around the globe.

          Cakes throughout the ages
        </h3>
        <p>
          The history of cakes dates back to ancient Egypt, where
          honey-sweetened breads and desserts were baked. As civilizations grew,
          so did the variety of cakes across the globe. Asia introduced rice
          cakes, while Middle Eastern cultures pioneered the art of
          pastry-making, adding fragrant spices and dried fruits. In Africa,
          millet and sorghum-based cakes were popular, while Latin America
          showcased their unique take on cakes, like the iconic tres leches.
          Today, cakes have become a universal indulgence, reflecting the
          diverse culinary traditions and flavors of people worldwide.

          Cookies since time began
        </h3>
        <p>
          Cookies have a rich and diverse history across the globe. In North
          America, Dutch and British immigrants popularized cookies in the 17th
          and 18th centuries. Europe witnessed the rise of buttery delights
          during the Middle Ages, with the Dutch serving as pioneers of modern
          cookie baking techniques. Africa introduced yam and cassava-based
          cookies, blending local ingredients with traditional methods. Asia
          embraced cookies with variety, from Indian "Nankhatai" to Chinese
          almond cookies. South American traditions brought indigenous
          ingredients like cocoa, corn, and sweet potatoes into cookie recipes,
          while the Middle East contributed flavors like dates and pistachios.
          Throughout centuries, cookie recipes traveled the world, evolving into
          the beloved treats we enjoy today.
